Keep track of inventory –
We need actual inventory and we also need to know pending shipments (customer has paid but item
has not been shipped) . A message needs to be sent to the order screen if a customer is ordering a
quantity of an item that will bring the inventory below zero. This includes the pending shipments.
A shipped item from the Second Part will deplete the actual inventory and pending orders. A successful
payment from the first part will increase the pending orders.
